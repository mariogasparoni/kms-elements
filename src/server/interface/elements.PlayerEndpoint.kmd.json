      <p>
      Retrieves content from seekable or non-seekable sources, and injects them into :term:`KMS`, so they can be delivered to any Filter or Endpoint in the same MediaPipeline. Following URI schemas are supported:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Files: Mounted in the local file system.
          <ul><li>file:///path/to/file</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          RTSP: Those of IP cameras would be a good example.
          <ul>
            <li>rtsp://<server-ip></li>
            <li>rtsp://username:password@<server-ip></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          HTTP: Any file available in an HTTP server
          <ul>
            <li>http(s)://<server-ip>/path/to/file</li>
            <li>http(s)://username:password@<server-ip>/path/to/file</li>

        </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
      For the player to stream the contents of the file, the server must have access to the resource. In case of local files, the user running the process must have read permissions over the file. For network resources, the path to the resource must be accessible: IP and port access not blocked, correct credentials, etc.The resource location can’t be changed after the player is created, and a new player should be created for streaming a different resource.
      </p>
      <p>
      The list of valid operations is
      <ul>
        <li>*play*: starts streaming media. If invoked after pause, it will resume playback.</li>
        <li>*stop*: stops streaming media. If play is invoked afterwards, the file will be streamed from the beginning.</li>
        <li>*pause*: pauses media streaming. Play must be invoked in order to resume playback.</li>
        <li>*seek*: If the source supports “jumps” in the timeline, then the PlayerEndpoint can
          <ul>
            <li>*setPosition*: allows to set the position in the file.</li>
            <li>*getPosition*: returns the current position being streamed.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

              By default, the input media gets decoded into a raw format before being processed by the media pipeline, because this allows Kurento to keep track of lost keyframes among other quality-control measurements. This of course has a cost in terms of processing power, but ensures that the output streaming will be robust and reliable. It is possible to disable this behavior by using this method, and in that case the encoded stream will be provided directly to the media pipeline, without prior decoding. Enabling this could have a severe effect on stability, because lost video keyframes will not be regenerated; however, this can be very useful to improve performance by greatly reducing the processing load.

              Keep in mind that if this option is enabled, the source media and target media MUST share the same format and codec configurations.

              We strongly recommend to avoid using this option, because correct behavior cannot be guaranteed.",
